# FocusDrive: Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alert System  

**FocusDrive** is a real-time driver drowsiness detection system that uses a **custom YOLOv5 model** in **PyTorch** to classify drivers as **awake or drowsy**. If drowsiness persists for **3 seconds**, an **audio alarm** is triggered to alert the driver. The system also logs session details, including total time, awake time, and drowsy time.
