# FocusDrive
FocusDrive is a real-time driver drowsiness detection system that uses a custom YOLOv5 model in PyTorch to classify drivers as awake or drowsy. If drowsiness persists for 3 seconds, an audio alarm is triggered to alert the driver. The system also logs session details, including total time, awake time, and drowsy time.
